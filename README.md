Deep machine learning model of Image Classifier through Neural Networks.

Predicting Pneumonia with given Chest X-ray Image.

Following information is from World Health Organization (WHO):

Pneumonia Facts
According to WHO, "Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs". When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli, small sacs make up the lung, are filled with pus and fluid instead of air, which causes painful respiration and limited oxygen intake.

In 2017, Pneumonia caused the death of 808,694 children younger than 5 years old and accounted for 15% of all deaths of children under as of 5. In result, "Pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide". Pneumonia all ages globally, however it is most common in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Economic costs
The best way to to reduce the cost is to prevent, however, it is inevitable to face such disease in given circumstances and environments. Children can be secured from Pneumonia with basic interventions, low-cost treatment, low-tech medication and care.

According to WHO, "the cost of antibiotic treatment for all children with pneumonia in 66 of the countdown to 2015 countries for maternal, newborn and child survival is estimated at around US $109 million per year. The price includes the antibiotics and diagnostics for pneumonia management."

By building the model with low cost machine with low prerequisites, yet high accuracy, we can further reduce the cost of diagonistics and bring better world together.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the final model chosen and I was able to bring 93% of model accuracy.

By successful prediction of patients with given Chest X-ray image, number of hospitalization will be reduced and simple treatment can be done which will save many $$$.

Future Work)

1) I would like to research other existing Neural Networks models.
2) By using cloud and other services, I would like to test the model with bigger data set and other parameters to find further results.
3) Find out more about how model failed to predict certain images.
